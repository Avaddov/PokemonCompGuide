    <h1>A Beginner's Guide to Competitive Pokémon</h1>
    <h3>by Dov Joseph (FiendRiver) Goldman </h3>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>So, you've decided to take your mastery of Pokémon to the next level! <br>
    Well, get ready because what you already know about Pokémon is just the beginning.</p>

    <p>Pokémon Battling is more than just smashing a powerful move and dealing damage. 
    Think of Competitive Pokémon like... </p>
    <p>Rock Paper Scisors with 18 different options, with the strategic planning of chess, and all of the caffiene.</p>
    <p>In short, Pokémon is a game about reading and outsmarting your opponents. <br>
    It is a turn based strategy game and cannot always be won by simply using raw power.</p>
    <br>
    You must first understand the capabilites of different Pokémon and how to raise them so they can perform their best in battle.
    <br>
    <p> In this course, we will be going over the basics of raising competitive Pokémon, 
    and with the way that Sword & Shield have streamlined the process and making competitive much more accessible, this should be a breeze.</p>
    <br>
    So without further ado, let's get right into it.</p>

    <a href="#EVintro"><button onclick='showSection("EVintro")'>Start</button></a>

    <div id="EVintro" style="display: none">

        <h2>EV Training</h2>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="EVintro_para1">
                <p> We will start by talking about Effort Values, or EVs for short. <br>
                EVs are another form of EXP and are part of what determines a Pokémon's stats grow and what they can become. <br> 
                EVs are usually gained by defeating Pokémon that will yield EVs in a specific stat, or by consuming vitamins, 
                which yield 10 specified EVs each and is the faster and easier method. <br>
                Think of it like working on certain muscles at the gym, or studying certain skills. <br>
                You can allocate a total of 510 EVs into a single Pokémon, each stat having a maximum cap of 252. <br>
                Because of this, in most cases, you will be investing 252 in the two most important stats, usually the appropritate attack stat, 
                as well as speed if it's a sweeper, or HP if it's a tank. <br>
                Defensive or supportive builds can be more complicated depending on the Pokémon, <br> but we'll get into that later. <br>
                First, let's start with this Charizard.</p>
                <p>We're going to max out this Charizard's Special Attack & Speed, because Charizard's main battle role is a special attacker. <br> More on roles later.</p>

        <div class="wrapper">
            <!-- <div class="EVintro_para2"> -->
            <p>First, we're going to need to make sure that it doesn't have any EVs invested. 
                This Charizard's EVs are already blank, but you can reset your Pokémon's EVs in one of two ways, either by consuming berries 
                (Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa & Tamato), each lowering 10 EVs in the specified stats, 
                OR by going to Lady Clear at the Workout Sea on the Isle of Armor in Pokémon Sword & Shield.</p>

        <p>Now, let's do the same thing for his speed!</p>

        <p>Select the Carbos from your bag.</p>

    <!-- FEATHERS -->
    <div id= feather1 style="display: none">
        <p>We still have one more thing to do before we move on. There are 6 EVs remaining (of only 4 we can actually benefit from), so let's finish this.</p>

        <p>For the remaining 6 EVs, we will use feathers. These allocate 1 EV each. Select the Clever Feather from the bag.</p>
        <p>NOTE: You can also use the traditional EV training method of defeating 4-6 Sp.Def EV yielding Pokemon, but we'll just use the feathers because it's faster.</p>

        <div id=EVresults style="display: none">

        <p>Let's take a look at what changed! As you can see, Charizard's stats are much higher now!</p>
        <img src="/Projects/PokemonTrainingGuide/images/charizardstatspostevboost.jpg" alt="">
        <p>We're not done yet. We still need to hyper train Charizard's Speed stat, give him a nature mint, change his ability and fix his moveset. <br> So let's move on.</p>
